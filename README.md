# BookStore
This was my final design project for my 2nd year Object Oriented Eng Analysis and Design course. Needless to say, this was one of the most difficult Java projects
that I've been assigned as we had to use JavaFX for all our windowing needs. The problem statement below gives a better understanding at how and what we were required
to implement.

## Problem Statement
You will develop a simple Book Store Application (app). The app must be graphical user interface
(GUI) based. The app should be a single-window GUI, that is, ONLY one window should be available
to the user of the app (analogous to a web browser). This implies that if a user of the app clicks a button
to obtain a new screen, the last screen of the app should be replaced by the new screen, in the SAME
window (i.e. multiple windows MUST NOT get opened while using the app).
Whenever a user of the app clicks the [x] button (i.e. the exit button) at the top-right of the app window, all the relevant data currently present in the app should be written in two relevant files books.txt
and customers.txt.
To keep the implementation simple, it is suggested that every time the [x] button is clicked, the old data
in books.txt and customers.txt should be overwritten by the current data present in the relevant data
structure(s) of the app. It is also suggested that every time the app is started, the data from the two files
books.txt and customers.txt should be loaded in the data structure(s) of the app.
There are two kinds of users of this application: Owner and Customer. Here we will assume there is
only one Owner and zero or more Customers who uses the application.
The app starts with a login-screen. The login-screen has three GUI items: a username field, a password
field, and the button [login]. The ownerâ€™s username is admin and password is admin
